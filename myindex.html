		<h1>The Importanc eof being Information Literate in an age of Fake News</h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p>I am going to be discussing the importance of developing information literacy skills in a society where the spread of fake news and misinformation is so prevalent. This project will explore the different forms of misinformation that frequently circle the web and detail the different components of information literacy that can be used to filter through the abundance of misinformation. The websites design will include comparisons of real news headlines VS fake news headlines, examples of deepfakes and also examples of propaganda, all of which are common examples of misinformation of varying degrees that are spread online. </p>
