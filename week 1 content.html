		<h1>Week 1 tasks</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>I am going to be discussing the importance of developing information literacy skills in a society where the spread of fake news and misinformation is so prevalent. This project will explore the different forms of misinformation that frequently circle the web and detail the different components of information literacy that can be used to filter through the abundance of misinformation.</a> </p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task2">
		<h2>Independant Learning 1</h2>
		<p>In my independant learning task I researched different topics I could base my project on:</p>
	
	<p><u>Information literacy in reltion to fake news:</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The over abundance of fake news that exists online today in the form of imposter content, parodies, propaganda, deepfakes, conspiracy theories, etc. </li>
			<li>The importance of developing information literacy skills in order to combat the misinformation users may come across online. For example, give users key things to look out for when searching for reliable sources online to eliminate the risk of coming across potentially harmful misinformation. </li>
			<li>Everyone in society can benefit from developing information literacy skills, but this project would focus more on the younger generation of users. </li>
			<li>Using this idea for my project would rely on a critical framework that would aide users in spotting fake news. The critical framework in question being one set out by Duffy, Tandoc and Ling which states that fake news can be discovered based on "two dimensions" of which are "the intetion to deceive and the level of facticity" (Duffy, Ling and Tandoc 2019:2). I would encourage users to think of fake news using this format which I beleive would make the process of spotting it and deconstructing it easier and more seamless. </li>
			<li>Younger users would be aware of the circulation of fake news and would be familiar with the workings of the web, for this reason they would be keen to learn more about something that they use so frequently in the most effective way. </li></ul>

				<p>The key words referred to as above did return appropriate results for my search, although very broad, it was helpful to look at different scopes as research for my topic is still undergoing, thus a broad search was very helpful in gathering a better idea of this topic as a whole. </p>
				<p><u>The Digital Divide and Social Exclusion</u></p>
				<ul>
					<li>As society relies on the use of the web more and more these days, it can lead to some people being left behind. </li>
					<li>People who may be left behind include: those who may no be as financially fortunate as to be able to afford an internet connection, the older generation who may not be as 'tech savvy', people in remote geographical areas who may not have stable internet connections, people whose home life may exclude them from gaining access to the web and also some people cultures and beliefs may not allow for them access to the web/certain parts of the web, etc.</li>
					<li>Covid-19 pandemic as an example of social exclusion caused by the digital divide as those who (as mentioned above) may not have access to the web would have been very socially excluded from the outside world where access to the web became a lifeline to many. </li>
					<li>Other areas of life the digital divide can socially exclude people. For example, some job interviews, etc are now conducted over web servers like 'Zoom', thus for those who do not have access to the web they could miss out on opportunities such as this. Additionally, a lot of news is also published via the web that can help people stay connected to the issues that affect them, hence without access to the web this may exclude them even further from staying in touch with the society around them.</li>
					<li>Everyone can benefit from learning more about the digital divide as it is such a prevalent issue and the more everyone has knowledge of it, the more we can do to reduce the effects of it.</li></ul>

						<p>The key words referred to as above did provide adequate search results, as the results of these searches contained a lot of different perspectives/ takes on the digital divide and how it affected certain groups of people in society which was useful to read about and gather knowledge on to widen personal awareness of just how far the digital divide has spread and how much social exclusion it can cause certain groups in society. </p>
						<p><u>Is the development of AI technology dangerous to society?</u></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Many people fear that the development of artificial intelligence technologies will take over society.</li>
							<li>People are concerned at how far advanced it is that it can respond to things the same way humans can. (most of the time) (use Turing test).</li>
							<li>Some also have concern that AI technologies can replace humans in the work place. </li>
							<li>This topic would be of interest to possibly young people as it will be up and coming generations that will see even bigger developments in AI than we are today. </li>
							<li>Thus, younger generations may be more keen to learn about the history of AI and the impact it may or may not have on their futures. </li></ul>
