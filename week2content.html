		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Audience Characteristics</th>
				<th>Rationale</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Age</td>
				<td>Younger generation of online users. Target mainly ages from 12-25 as internet usage becomes more prevalent from the age of 12 onwards for both recreational use on social media platforms to possibly research for school work etc. Thus, tone of voice etc does not need to be sort of infantilised as the age range of the target audience are able to comprehend a more professional and formal tone of voice in an educational space.</td>
			</tr>
				<td>Gender</td>
				<td>Mixed audience. Language and tone of voice will thus remain gender neutral and formal so as to cater to all genders and not prioritise one over the other through language use.</td>
			</tr>
				<td>Language Proficiency</td>
				<td>The content will be in English. However, will be mindful of non-English speakers who may not be completely proficient in the language. This will be achieved through not making the content of the website overly-complicated and convoluted, and instead will look to a more simplistic use of language that is equally as effective as intricate use of language. This will also be an important aspect in regard to the targeted age range of the content too as a person at the age of twelve may not have the same developed language skills of some at twenty five. </td>
			</tr>
				<td>Educational Level</td>
				<td>Education level ranging from high school through to college/university. Due to the content adhering to such a wide scope of educational settings, as before mentioned the content will be linguistically accessible to any user no matter the educational level they are currently at. Simplistic content can still be intellectually simulating if the content is purposeful and of high quality. </td>
			</tr>
				<td>Attitude toward writer/organisation</td>
				<td>I would say the audience is neutral on the chosen subject. It is a subject that the audience should be keen to learn more about as it directly affects their day-to-day life, thus they have no reason to be sceptical of the content or the cause. There may be feelings of intimidation of the subject matter due to how vast the subject area is and also how prevalent an issue the content directly refers to is. Education on any topic may be intimidating to an audience, this is no different.</td>
			</tr>
				<td>Knowledge of the topic</td>
				<td>The website and its content will assume that the audience has awareness but limited knowledge on the topic. This will allow for a more thorough investigation of the topics to be discussed that will allow all users to start from the same level.</td>
			</tr>
				<td>Audience action</td>
				<td>My aim is for the audience to become more aware of the fake news that they most likely will encounter online due to the many forms it can be presented in, and to subsequently use their information literacy skills to identify and tackle these sources that will hopefully give fake news less of a platform to spread on if more and more people become educated on what it amens to be information literate. </td>

<p><u>Task 3</u></p>
<p>Methods used: user needs statements and user stories. ( so far only created with being in the mindset of proposed audience).</p>
<p><b>User Needs Statement</b></p>
<p>(template taken from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-need-statements/"> "Nielsen Norman Group"</a>)</p>
<p>[Amy, a secondary school pupil] needs [to be able to identify sources of fake news quickly and confidently] in order to [enjoy the hobbies she posses such as watching YouTube videos and reading celeb magazines without the fear of buying into misinformation].</p>
<p><b>User Stories</b></p>
<p>(template taken from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs"> "UK Government Website"</a>)</p>
<p>	As a [ 20 year old female and university student]
	I need/want/expect to [be able to comfortably and confidently explore a range of online information in aide of my studies and be able to recognise and trust that they are reliable sources of information]
So that [I can maximise the use of online sources at my disposal while maintaining good grades through turning in high quality pieces of work enriched by reliable sources of information]</p>
<p><i>(more methods to be added once people of age group have been questioned)</i></p>
<p><u>Reflective Statement:</u></p>
<p>I have chosen to set my target audience as a mixed age from the range of 12-25 of mixed gender as I feel as though within these ages internet use is most prevalent - certainly from personal experience- and thus, between these ages is the most imperative time to develop information literacy skills in order to tackle the masses of misinformation that users are likely to come across. Another reason for my chosen audience is that I feel between this age range interests are similar in regards to social media and current trends etc, for example, people in my targeted audience are more likely to read a fake tabloids article on the trendiest celebrity at the time rather than a sixty year old man. For this reason, the content of the website can also be adhered to conform to current trends to make the content more relatable to users, through using side-by-side articles of one real and one fake about (for example) Kylie Jenner.</p>

		<h2>Lab Tasks</h2>
		<p><u>Task 1</u></p>
		<p>Websites chosen for discussion: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ "> "The White House Website"</a> & <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/"> "The Yale School of Art Website"</a></p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Both websites have specific audiences. The White House website is clearly aimed at American citizens who are keen to keep up with the politics of their nation and issues that affect them and their day-to-day lives. In comparison, the Yale School of Art website is aimed at arts students within the school that wish to collaborate on this digital project. </li>
				<li>The range and depth of material on The White House website I would argue is appropriate for the targeted audience as users can easily navigate the information available on a variety of prevalent issues and topics that the White House deals with through the blog-style way the website is set up. On the other hand, I would argue that the Yale School of Art website is also appropriate for its audience as it is targeted towards those who understand digital design and can easily pick apart and analyse the website, unlike the regular user who would immediately look at the website and feel overwhelmed by the extravagant and over-the-top nature of it- it may look messy to those who donâ€™t understand, but it has clearly been created to serve a purpose. </li>
				<li>The White House website does not provide an abundance of interaction, interaction on the website only stretches as far as being able to select a further link on a person/topic of interest that can be further explored, but it does not contain any sort of interactive activities. Having said this, however, the website is not designed to be interactive, it is designed as a means to stay in touch with the American people who are seeking information on certain things. The website does also provide contact details near the bottom of the page, it is easy to spot because it states in capitalisation 'We Want To Hear From You', thus the website makes it clear that those in power do want to hear the thoughts of users/citizens. In this section it also gives the option to 'send a text message to President Biden' which gives the website more of a personal touch that makes users feel more included and make them feel like their voices can be heard by 'texting' the President. In comparison, the Yale school of Art website is slightly more interactive than the White House website as it contains more further links that can take people to the desired area of the website they are searching for. It also contains a calendar of events that takes up a pretty large proportion of the website that users can click into for further details. The website also gives users the opportunity to add projects, work and thoughts and you can also go on and change the homepage background. </li>
				<li>The purpose of the White House Website, as before mentioned, is to create as space where American citizens can explore a range of information about issues that directly affect them. It can also be used for educational purposes in regards to political issues and providing transparency to users that is beneficial in letting them they the work carried out by those they elected which can also help in educating voters as well. Comparatively, the purpose of the Yale School of Art website is for the educational purposes of its students learning more about digital design. The website, in my opinion, is purposefully messy and is even more messy for the fact users can go on and change certain aspects for it. Again, I think this is to aide in the education of art students by allowing them to play around with different aspects of digital design, and of course allowing them to see a prime example of bad design. </li>
				<li>The White House website uses very simplistic design that makes it easy to focus on the information of the page without being distracted by an overabundance of different pictures, colours, fonts etc. Everything displayed on the website has been chosen to serve a purpose and not just inserted at random. On the other hand, the Yale School of Art website is drastically different in their design. The overall design of the website is very loud and messy and makes it difficult to navigate and focus on the information on the website due to so much going on around it. There is no colour scheme or consistent use of the same font and font size, etc which can make it very overwhelming to look at as a user. However, to their targeted audience, as previously said, this might be of use as their audience is of those who have experience in digital design and can use their experience on the website as a learning curve on do's and don'ts. </li>
				<li>The content of the White Houses website is readable and reliable as it is coming directly from the White House and not through a third-party. In comparison, as before mentioned the content on the Yale School of Art website is not very reliable due to the layout of the website and the overuse of colour and font, etc. The information on the website also may not be the most reliable because the website is designed for students to go in and edit and add to the website, thus it is subject to multiple editors and varying opinions, concepts etc.  </li></ul>
			</p>
			<p><u>Task 2</u></p>
			<p>The range and depth of information on the White House's website is very informative and is a good way of getting information across to users. Their method of delivering quality information in separate areas of the website is an effective way to garner users attention without overloading them with lots of information. It is easily broken down in to more digestible sections in a way that would be beneficial to my target audience who may only want to focus on certain aspects of the topic they are interested in. Comparatively, the Yale School of Art's website does not deliver information in an effective way, it is hard to focus on the information on the page due to the overwhelming amount of things going on around it- for my target audience this would look rather intimidating and would immediately lose their interest. </p>
			<p>While the Yale School of Art website does incorporate the use of different colour and fonts, they do not do so in an effective way. However, the use of varying colours and fonts is something that I will adopt in my website as for a younger audience this may make the content look more exciting and gripping as opposed to the drab and dull colours used on the White House Website which I would argue is not catered (colour and font wise) to the younger user as it looks very serious and not something that a younger user would be excited to use. </p>
