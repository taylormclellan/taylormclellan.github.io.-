		<p><u>Task 1</u></p>
		<ul><li><b>What I want the audience to take away from my website:</b> First and foremost, I would like my website to set out the terms of what it means to be information literate and the different components of information literacy that I discussed in my project proposal. I would also like to give users an experience of getting to identify the differences between real pieces of information and pieces of fake information by presenting a side-by-side example of a real headline and a fake news headline. Also possibly present a representation of a deepfake example in order to let users see how realistic they are. I could also conder the possibility of deconstructing a conspiracy theory to show proof of how fabricated they are. Through giving users experiences with all of these things, I would hope that they develop the skills to critically analyse future sources of information they come across to determine the reliability of it. I would also hope that the critical skills they develop can be applied to other areas of their life, whether that be their job or their studies. Overall, I would aim to provide users with a new way of approaching interactions online, starting with not being so quick to trust everything that is presented to them under the guise of a reliable source. </li>
			<li><b>Narrative points:</b> Begin with the types of fake news that circulate online (the specifics mentioned in proposal). Second to this, define information literacy and the different aspects of it (also outlines in proposal). Moving on, bridge both information literacy and fake news together; how does information. Literacy skills help combat fake news? Other aspects of life that information literacy skills can be applied to. </li>
			<li><b>Age group:</b> As previously discussed, my website will adhere to a younger audience of around 12-25. I would expect their educational background to be similar in regards to secondary school and maybe for some college and university and employment for others. </li>
			<li><b>Narrative voice:</b> I aim to take more of an informal approach to narrative voice. The reason for this is that I believe that having a more informal narrative voice will make my content more relatable to my audience, thus it may make it that bit more appealing to them. Comparatively, it can be argued that if I took a more formal approach to my content it may make the content appear more complicated and intimidating than it needs to be. The content of my website is supposed to be accessible to a younger generation of users so that they can apply the information provided to them to their own daily lives and hopefully take something away from what they have learned. </li></ul>

		<h2>Reflective Statement</h2>
		<p>My chosen narrative point combine well to create an overarching story. Each point stands on its own and will be explored in depth to make sure users have a clear understanding of both the fake news element of the project and the information literacy element of the project. The narrative points plotted allows these two specific themes to bridge together to compliment each other in the creation of an example of the danger of one and the usefulness of the other; how one can be used to cancel out the other. My narrative points also compliment my design ideas well as my design ideas-so far- consist of presenting examples users can use to apply their developing information literacy skills. </p>
