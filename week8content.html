		<h1>Week 8 tasks</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Independant Learning tasks</h2>
		<p><u>Task 1</u></p>
		<p><b>Website used for audio analysis:</b></p>
		<p><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/press-play-on-tape " >"Press Play on Tape"</a></p>
		<p>Although this website does not relate to my topic, I have chosen it to analyse because I think it displays a very effective use of audio.</p>
		<p><ul><li>Sound used to tell a story. The use of sound relates to the subject matter of each project and aides in their presentation. </li></p>
			<p><li>An example on the website of audio used with intent can be seen within the 'Hack Market' project. In the description, the website claims to be 'crafting the sound of digital rebellion', which is immediately recognisable to the user upon hearing the audio. The use of digital sounds that we are all familiar with, like the loop of the 'airdrop' sound helps emphasise the project at hand. Example of repeated airdrop symbol reflected in image as it is in audio:</p>
				<p><img src="week8-airdrop.jpg" alt="AirDrop" style="width:350px;height=300px;"></p>
				<p>Image is of people on phones surrounded by AirDrop notifications.</p></li>
			
<p><li>An advantage of the use of sound within each project is how similar they sound to what is perception of the subject matter- it is like a psychological instinct that makes users immediately relate both the use of audio and an image/subject and I think this website captures this entirely. For example, the Remy Martin Cognac video concept and audio pair together really well due to the pairing of a luxurious, rich sounding piece of audio combined with a luxurious alcohol. A possible disadvantage, however, is maybe the lack of use of voice- it is purely instrumental, manufactured sounds, and I think there is only so much you can gain from this. </li></p>
</p><li>Audio is often combined with images and also video to enhance the production of the product. Again, look to the example of the Cognac advert, the pairing of rich audio, high quality video maintains an air of luxury surrounding the product. The video itself is very minimalist and simplistic, but again, I think this keeps with the theme of luxury that the brand are promoting. </li></p>
<p><li>	Example of luxurious aesthetic discussed:</p>
					<p><img src="week8-cognac.jpg" alt="Cognac" style="width:350px;height=300px;" ></p>
					<p>Image is of a luxury bottle of cognac.</p></li></ul>
	<p><b>My updated moodboard:</b></p>
	<img src="week-8-moodboard.jpg" alt="week 8 moodboard" style="width:900px;height=700px;"></p>
	<p>Image is of a moodboard mapping my creative process</p>
<p><u>Task 2</u></p>
<p><b>My chosen audio from: <a href="http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/">"BBC Sound Effects"</a></b></p>
<p>My first audio piece is of the chatter of news reporters. This is relevant to my topic as it highlights how news is a continuous, lively cycle- fake or not: </p>
<audio controls>
	<source src="bbc-news-chatter.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<p>	My second piece of audio is the sound of typing on a computer. This relates to my topic as it displays the sound effect of someone typing on a computer- possibly for work, creating a new source of information, etc. I though of it as the sound track of the creation of information.</p>
<audio controls>
<source src="bbc-computer-typing.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

		<section id="task2">
		<h2>Lab Tasks</h2>
		<p><u>Tasks 1 & 2</u></p>
		<p>For this task I cropped my audio of newsroom chatter to a more suitable portion. After this I exported derivative audio files in different siund qualities and formats, each of which I experimented editing with. I have attached all of these files below.</p>
		<ol>
		<p><li>WAV file 001</p>
			<p><audio controls>
				<source src="news-room-chatter-001.wav" type="audio/wav">
			</audio>
		</p>
			<p><ul><li>Bass and treble, distortion and wahwah added to file.</li>
				<li> The 'wahwah' effect is very over-powering, you cannot hear much of the original file. It sort of sounds like a news signal being lost, etc.</li></ul>
			</p></li>
			<p><li>MP3 medium stereo 002</p>
				<p><audio controls>
					<source src="news-room-chatter-medium-stereo-002.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				</audio></p>
				<p><ul><li>Fade in: audio gradually gets louder.</li>
<li>Applied high-pass filter (1000 Hz, 48dB): removes low frequency sounds. The background noises within the audio, like camera clicks, etc ae much louder than voices.</li></ul>
</p></li>
<p><li>MP3 standard stereo 003</p>
	<audio controls>
		<source src= "news-room-chatter-standard-stereo-003.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
	</audio></p>
	<p><ul><li>Echo (delay time 1 second & decay: 1)</li>
		<li> The audio gradually gets nosier and a lot busier as all the echoes merge together.</li> 
		<li>I find this reflective of how noisy our heads can get with the amount of news sources that are out there; this is an auditorial representation of the anxiety an overhwelming amount of information causes as the noise gets louder and louder with every news source competing for attention. </li></ul></p></li>
		<p><li> MP3 medium mono 004</p>
		<p> <audio controls>
			<source src= "news-room-chatter-medium-mono-004.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio></p>
		<p><ul><li>Applied filter curve EQ. Heightened it so the audio seems extra loud. </p></li></ul></li></ol>
